# doenter (Docker Enter)

**doenter** is an utility that allows you to **obtain a shell** inside the [Docker for Mac Beta](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/) **xhyve** virtual machine.

A shell inside that Virtual Machine is useful because:

- Customize configurations or Docker Daemon options
- Use a custom way to share files with the host instead of osxfs
- Personalize networks
- Ideas to come
